### How do I get set up? ###

Hardware

You can search on Ebay for "Aduino Uno" and "Arduino MIDI SHIELD".
It should cost less than 15 â‚¬, shipping included.
You simply have to put the Midi shield into the Arduino Uno socket. 
That's all you have to do !!

Firmware download and uploading to the Arduino.

Download the Volkaoss binary firmware BETA1 for Arduino Uno here.  
This is a beta version, so you know what it means !   
To push the bin firmware to the Arduino, you will need the excellent XLOADER utility, from Russemoto.  
Arduino is usually found on COM 4 or COM 5 after you have plugged the USB cable.

I don't publish the sources because that was a lot of work, and it needs cleaning and formatting. I will probably do in a next future, if users like Volkaoss. For the moment, if you want to support Volkaoss, you can donate !
